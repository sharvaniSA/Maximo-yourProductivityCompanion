Here's a basic `README.md` template for your Maximo project, a full-stack MERN web application:

```markdown
# Maximo - Task Management App

Maximo is a full-stack MERN web application that helps you manage your tasks and milestones efficiently. It features a Pomodoro timer, a to-do list, Eisenhower Matrix for task prioritization, milestone setter, and more. Maximo helps you stay organized, focused, and productive.

## Features
- **Pomodoro Timer**: A timer to enhance focus by following the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break).
- **To-Do List**: Add, delete, and manage your tasks with ease.
- **Eisenhower Matrix**: Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, categorizing tasks into four quadrants.
- **Milestone Setter**: Set milestones with tasks, descriptions, and deadlines.
- **Priority Setter**: Prioritize tasks based on the 1-3-5 rule (1 important task, 3 medium tasks, and 5 small tasks).
- **User Profile**: Update user profile information, with the option to log out.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure login and signup

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: You need to have MongoDB running locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharvaniSA/Maximo-yourProductivityCompanion
   cd maximo-mini-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - For the frontend:
   
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

   - For the backend:
   
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
   - Add the following environment variables:

     ```bash
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/maximo
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     PORT=5000
     ```

   Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` with a secret key of your choice.

4. **Start the project:**

   - Run the backend (server):

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```

   - Run the frontend (client):

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

5. The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the frontend and [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for the backend.

## Usage

1. **Create an account**: Go to the landing page and click on "Get Started" to create a new account or log in to your existing account.
2. **Use the Pomodoro Timer**: Start the timer to work in focused intervals of 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break.
3. **Manage Tasks**: Add tasks to your to-do list, prioritize them with the Eisenhower Matrix, and set milestones to track your progress.
4. **View User Profile**: Access your profile to update your details and log out when you're done.
